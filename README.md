This is my first ever game jam submission for Godot Wild Jam 74

## About This Project

This game was inspired by the old Lucas Arts Desktop Adventure Games and also the various apartments I have lived in.  I was hoping to do more custom assets and sounds, however time and life constraints prevented me.

​## Controls

​There is mainly WASD movement in the game, however you do need to click on a tool to "Equip" it. Much like the older games.

## Technical Aspects

I have played a little with the Godot Engine here and there while I was working, however this is the actual first game I released with it. Before I left working in the tech industries in the 2010s. I did some application develop I leaned on that. However the way I did it made me learn how to work with a signal bus. I also learned a lot of how make custom resources and working with tilemaps. This is also the first time I have worked with git. So if you want to see the source code. Check it out here
